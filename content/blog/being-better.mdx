This is a mini blog, I talk about how I used data and metrics to change some of my habits to increase performance, focus, and mood.

There are two primary goals I wanted to achieve:

1. Reach 15k steps per day in the least possible time while being in Zone 2 (Cardio).

2. Reduce doomscrolling across all the apps.

I computed the data for the last couple of weeks of my health and screen time app to make some actionable steps.

## Health

The core metrics that my fitness tracker tracks are:

1. Steps

2. Workout Time

3. Distance

4. Heart Rate Zone

Speed and cadence can be computed from the above data. What I found was

Since, its obvious that HR zone and cadence are directly proportional to speed. So I just needed to increase the speed, but how much?
Thats the million dollar question!

So what I found was if I increased my speed to be above 4 km/hr, it would boost the other two metrics:

I still haven’t reached the target, but I am in a better position now. With the new numbers building up, I think I'll be able to further optimize it.

## Screen Time

For this, I didn’t exactly "compute" any numbers; I just made educated decisions based on the habits and trends I saw I saw in the app.

The general idea that I applied here is to increase the friction as much as possible and make my phone a boring entity.

Things that I did:

1. Disabled double tap, fingerprint, extended unlock → Make a conscious choice to unlock and open.

2. Use a 16+ character password instead of a pattern lock → Make it hard and tedious to unlock the phone.

3. Blocked notifications for all apps except critical apps like WhatsApp, Messages, and Phone → Keeps unnecessary pings muted.

4. Disabled notification sound and vibration for all apps → Keeps unnecessary pings muted.

5. Removed all the apps and widgets from the home screen; only kept the Phone app → Increase friction and make conscious choice to launch an app.

6. Uninstall all distracting apps (social media, OTT, and YouTube) → Root cause of doomscrolling.

7. Hide less frequently used apps like Amazon and Gallery, but keep them reachable in a couple of clicks → Increase friction to launch apps.

8. Set the phone to 'ultra power saving mode' → Limits apps and app background usage to further increase the friction.

9. Black wallpaper everywhere → Keeps me always from scrolling my wallpaper collection.

10. Hide the phone in another room, drawer, or backpack. → I use my watch to get notified for calls.

11. Enable greyscale → Makes phone more boring.

12. **(Bonus)** Change the screen guard to matte (the one that doesn’t reflect light) → I like to watch stuff in high resolution, but matte layers add a sort of graininess.

In laptop, it's pretty much the same, except a few things. I have extensions to block OTT sites or block feeds and other distracting components on YouTube.

The only sources of entertainment when I am by myself are music, online courses, books (both hard and soft copy), and the gym.
